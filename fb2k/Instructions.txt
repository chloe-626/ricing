My Foobar themes, base is ncmpcpp_mod and SP8.

To use:

	Install Foobar in portable mode
	In your Foobar directory delete the file called "user_profiles_enabled"
	Move the contents from this zip to that folder, overwrite any files.
	Then in Foobar go to Preferences > Display > UI > select Columns UI
	Then go to Columns UI > Main and Import FCL.

If it doesn't work try uninstalling Foobar and then download this zip file which contains my entire Foobar directory, easiest way to install it and have it work w/o errors tbh.

To customize right click the song list and the top bar and go to Settings.

To customize the search bar click just before the the Search text or click the search icon and look in Options

Right click to collapse/expand albums

Right click song list > Settings > Style to bring back scrollbar

Sometimes elements will bug out but minimizing and then restoring Foobar will fix them, or switching to playlists then back.
