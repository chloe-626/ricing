<h2>AHK - </h2>

All scripts that I use including Scrot, Hotkeys, Tiling, Opacity and TbarIconBlanker.
Change the locations in Scrot, make sure that you have IrfanView downloaded, and my tiling is setup for two monitors so obviously only some hotkeys would work with one, ~make sure numlock is turned off~.

<h2>BBLEAN - </h2>

Plugins that I've edited for bbLean, styles that I've made for it.

<h2>FB2 - </h2>

Includes all components that you'd need for the skins, if it doesn't work install the ncmp mod and follow the [faq](http://pastebin.com/QbGNnzsZ) for that, if you're already familar with fb (and installed the mod) you won't have any problems.

<h2>MISC RICE - </h2>

As the title says, programs that make ricing a lot easier.

<h2>RAINMETER - </h2>

Skins that I use, either made from scratch or super super edited from someone else.

For the InfoBar skin it should work out of the box, obviously you do need OpenHardware running though.

The commands that currently work in the bar are: shot, google [searchtext], phait, moko, tmblr and /w/.
Edit bar.lua and scroll to the bottom to make your own commands.

To get the temps and percentages to work in System Info:
 - Run OpenHardwareMonitor (included) 
 - Put a shortcut to it in your startup folder
 - Edit the System Info skin and change the hardware information to your own.

<h2>VS - </h2>

Read [this](http://neiio.deviantart.com/art/How-to-Install-Custom-Themes-262833454) if you've never installed a VS, these are all just backups, I'd recommend getting a VS from [here](http://decagonal.deviantart.com/) as I update them there.
