Requirements
------------

Dual Monitor Tools should run on any implementation of Windows that has
.NET 2.0 installed.
Obviously you should have two or more monitors attached to the computer.

Installation
------------

There is currently no installer, so you need to copy the files yourself
to a suitable directory. 

SwapScreen
----------

This is a small tool that when started resides in the System Tray.
It allows you to assign hotkeys for various actions.
The main hotkey allows you to move the active window to the next screen.
This will also work if the active window is a maximised window.
There are also some hotkeys to emulate functionality that is built into
Windows 7, such as minimising and maximising the active window, so
users of XP and Vista can also use these.
Further hotkeys allow all windows on a particular monitor to be minimised
and to rotate the contents of the monitors.
This tool also allows you to restrict mouse movement between screens.

DualLauncher
------------

Dual Launcher allows you to launch your favourite applications with a 
few key strokes and to position them at pre-configured positions on any
of your monitors.

DualWallpaper
-------------

Dual Wallpaper simplifies the process of using images as wallpaper on 
multiple monitor setups

You can have a single image which is spread across all of your monitors,
or you can have different images on each monitor, or if you have enough
monitors, you could say have an image spread across 2 of your monitors
with another image displayed on the third monitor.

It also correctly sets the wallpaper when your primary monitor is not
your leftmost or topmost monitor.

DisMon (Beta software)
------

This allows you to change the enabled monitors and/or to change the
primary monitor while an application is run, with the monitor state
being restored when the application has finished running.
The application to run is specified as the first parameter to DisMon.
Any further parameters are passed onto the application.
Remember to enclose any paths or parameters within double quotes if
they contain spaces.

There is also a GUI to disable monitors and/or change the primary
monitor manually.

DualSnap
--------

This is a small tool that when started resides in the System Tray.
It allows you to assign a hotkey which when pressed will capture 
the image on the primary screen and (optionally) display it on the
secondary screen.

It remembers previous screen captures (up to a configurable number)
and these may be reviewed later on and either copied to the clipboard
or saved as PNG files.


Uninstall
---------

To uninstall the programs, you will need to remove any shortcuts you
manually added, remove the files you unzipped and remove the
configuration and data files.

The configuration and data files for the tools may be found under:
%LOCALDATA%\GNE.
Typically this directory is something like C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local. 

If you have nothing else in %LOCALAPPDATA%\GNE that you want to keep,
then it should be safe to delete this directory.


Known problems
--------------

If you wish SwapScreen to fully work when you have windows from applications
that have been 'Run as Administartor', then you will also need to start
SwapScreen with 'Run as Administrator'.

DisMon has problems on Windows 7 when the (initial) primary monitor is
disabled.  Also on Windows XP, the task bar does not move with the primary
monitor.
