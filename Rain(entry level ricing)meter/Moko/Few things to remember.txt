0. Edit the .ini's to make the skins work for you.
 
 - User works basically out of the box, just change the avatar location to your account's name.

 - System info requries a little more changes, search for "; ////////" and change the theme name, bbLean style name, and the name of the hardware you're using, open HardwareMonitor and copy it exactly as the program says, you may also need to change the number of cores depending.

1. Rename OpenHardwareMonitor to a .exe, install it from the folder, minimize to tray and put it in your startup folder (C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup) so it starts with your pc.

2. If you can't move a skin go to settings and uncheck Keep on Screen and Snap to Edges, for the dropdowns drag the dropdown and not the icon.
If that doesn't work, if you rice you probably have AltDrag or a script to move windows so that works.

3. To change the weather go to www.weather.com and grab the part of the url after the slash but before the semicolon, replace it in Info.txt at the top.

4. To get mail working replace 'EMAIL' and 'PASSWORD' with yours, don't include the @etc part of your email.
eg. Url=https://myemail:mypassword@mail.google.com
Replace mail.google with whatever alternative mail domain you use.

5. The Virtuawin skin will only work if you have Virtuawin installed and running, it's literally pointless and you might as well unload it if you don't use Virtuawin.

6. For Waifu as long as it's a render and around 500-600 in height then it'll work, just edit the filename in waifu.ini

7. Bar is for 2 monitors and Bar2 is for one monitor, just edit the width(W) to make it fit your screen.
